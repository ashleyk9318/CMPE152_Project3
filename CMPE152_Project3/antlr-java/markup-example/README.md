# ANTLR4 Tutorial - Java Project
Team 10: Yosimy Cortes, Ashley Kim, Minjoung Kim, Steven Lu

The purpose of this project is to write ANTLR v4 grammar.

The program includes: ANTLR v4 grammar, lexer, parser, visitor, lister, and railroad diagram for the ANTLR v4 grammar. 

The ANTLR v4 grammar is written using ANTLR compiler generator tool. 
The lexer, parser, listner, and visitor are generated using the ANTLR v4 grammar using Java as ANTLR target language. 
The railroad diagram is generated by Eclipse ANTLR tool.

The commands you need to know:

// to generate the program use maven
mvn package
// to launch the application
java -cp target/markup-example-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar src.main.java.MarkupParser.App
// to run the tests
mvn test
